Professor Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer<br/>
grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on<br/>
your plate, nearly every part of the world around you carries<br/>
 special chemical makers. These makers,&nbsp;called isotopes,can<br/>
tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance<br/> 
are from, where they traveled and what happened to them <br/>
along the way.But doing these analyses has been complex<br/>
and costly.Now,Stanford chemists have developed a new<br/> 
method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.</td>
